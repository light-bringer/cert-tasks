Goal
Build a small RESTful API in Go that allows a client to create and manage “tasks.” Please keep the solution deliberately simple. We expect the assignment to take no more than 2–3 hours to complete.
Requirements
A Task has:
id (string or int; generated by the service)
title (string, required, non-empty)
description (string, optional)
status (enum/string: "todo" | "done", default "todo")
created_at (timestamp)
updated_at (timestamp)
REST endpoints
Implement these endpoints with JSON request/response bodies:
Create a task
POST /tasks
Request: { "title": "...", "description": "..." }
Response: 201 Created with the created task
List tasks
GET /tasks
Response: 200 OK with an array of tasks
No pagination, sorting, filtering.
Get a task
GET /tasks/{id}
Response: 200 OK with the task, or 404 Not Found
Update a task
PUT /tasks/{id}
Request: full replacement, e.g. { "title": "...", "description": "...", "status": "todo|done" }
Response: 200 OK with updated task, or 404 Not Found
Delete a task
DELETE /tasks/{id}
Response: 204 No Content, or 404 Not FoundGoal
